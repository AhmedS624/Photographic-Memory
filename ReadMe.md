# Final-Project2.0
a program that lets you memorize difficult concepts with pictures
Do you know what is a mind palace or the method of loci or memory journey
it is a strategy for memory enhancment,which uses vusualization of familiar spatial environments in order to engance the recall of information
you can read more about it here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci

but basicly this webapp is designed to help you optimize your memorizing of information using this very strategy

How does it work 
simply you choose your palace (the physical space to put your info you want memorized in) it could be your home your way to work even your own body
then you select checkpoint it is recomended to not assign more then necccesarry for exmple if the palace is your home assign 5 checkpoints per room

Example
Palace : home
checkpoint 1: door 
chekpoint 2: sofa
checkpint 3: TV
...etc

then you make the cards(info) now this is the fun parn as you let your imagination run wild to turn your information into into a picture or a short story

then assign it to a checkpoint

let's take the word Quintessential for example when I see this word I see the "Queen" of England (RIP) with a red full bag of "essential" stuff

now to put that mind image in a checkpoint

Palace : home
checkpoint 1: door card Quintessential = Queen + essential Explanation: I pass by the Queen standing at the door with her red bag full of essentials
              and she calls me a typical human
              (the word quintessential means typical)
              
Now try to forget that image of your head or the meaning of the word
